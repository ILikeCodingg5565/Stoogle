## 🔧 Configuration

Run the configuration file (`config.py`) to customize the script. 

## ⚠️ FLAGS
   
This is flagged if you build it with PyInstaller, as some AntiViruses automatically flag Python .EXEs
I am working on a way to fix this. 

## 🛠️ Changelog  (month/day/year)

## 🍪 Cookie Stealer Info
   
Making the cookie stealer was an interesting challenge.
I decided that killing chrome is the easiest way to do it (chrome doesnt let you access cookies when its open, UNLESS you have admin)
Obviously running with admin isn't an option.
